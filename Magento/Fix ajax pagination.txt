Here is the solution that i applied : In smartwave porto look for this file(ajax.phtml) in my case it located in here :

\app\design\frontend\smartwave\porto\template\smartwave\ajaxcatalog\ajax.phtml
Find this line in that file

"url.replace(page_param," ");"
somewhere around line 160 and 369. and change that with this in both locations. Your pagination thing will work :)

"url.replace(page_param,page_param);"
I'm attaching the block where you need to change this line.

var hist = url;
                        if(url.indexOf("p=") > -1){
                            var len = url.length-url.indexOf("p=");
                            var str_temp = url.substr(url.indexOf("p="),len);
                            var page_param = "";
                            if(str_temp.indexOf("&") == -1){
                                page_param = str_temp;
                            } else {
                                page_param = str_temp.substr(0,str_temp.indexOf("&"));
                            }
                            hist = url.replace(page_param,""); /* Change here !! */
