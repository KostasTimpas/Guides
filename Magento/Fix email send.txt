In latest Magento versions, all emails are being sent via CRON job. Every email will be queued and sending will depend on the set interval, in general 5 minutes.




By default, Magento has already set CRON jobs at 
System -> Configuration -> Advanced -> System -> Advanced -> Cron




If CRON job is not working properly, please follow below steps to send instant emails.




Copy Template.php file from 
app -> code -> core -> Mage -> Core -> Model -> Email




Create folder structure like 
app -> code -> local ->  Mage -> Core -> Model -> Email




Paste Template.php file in Email folder




Open Template.php file and go to line number 407 or search for the following code 
 if ($this->hasQueue() && $this->getQueue() instanceof Mage_Core_Model_Email_Queue) {




Replace above code with following
 if (!($this->hasQueue()) && $this->getQueue() instanceof Mage_Core_Model_Email_Queue) {




This trick works perfectly on Magento ver. 1.9.2.0
